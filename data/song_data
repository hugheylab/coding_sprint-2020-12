We were warm and wonderful
Once upon a time
But now we're frozen, hanging by a thread
Can we wait a minute?
Or can we just try to try?
'Cause my favorite day is coming up ahead
[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year
That makes us lose our way, just say we'll make up
And hold on a little longer
Don't have me spending it alone
This time of year is precious
Please, can we make it to Christmas?
Can we make it to Christmas?
[Chorus]
(Christmastime) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Everything will be alright) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(If we just hold on) Can we just make it to Christmas?
(Hold on, ho-o-old on) Make it to Christmas
[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'll say to Dad when he sees the empty chair
Don't want to hear my mom say, ""Told you so""
Waiting for Santa in my bed is no fun if you're not there
And I don't want to be angry at mistletoes
[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, I know that our love is going cold
It's just something 'bout the snow this time of year

For the season to come
When the snowflakes are falling
And our family is one
It's that time before Christmas
Just when the magic begins
I see millions of candles
Lighting up every home
See the poor and the homeless they'll be all be alone
It's that time before Christmas
Just when the goodness begins
Before Christmas I'm falling in love
Before Christmas I'm falling in love
Like a child I am wishing
Mistletoе kissing
And falling in love again
All the peoplе are longing
For good fortune they plea
Making a new years promise
How their future may be
It's that time before Christmas

Before Christmas I'm falling in love
Before Christmas I'm falling in love

Mistletoe kissing
And falling in love again
So let's hope that this Christmas
Will be more than just a dream
It's the moment that we've all have been waiting for
Let's appreciate togetherness
Sharing all happiness
And keep our dreams alive
Forever more
Oh so long I've been waiting

Mistletoe kissing
And falling in love again
Oh I'm falling in love again

'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the moodI'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
[Pre-Chorus]
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If he will be, if he will be here

On your own front door
A pair of Hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Bonny and Ben
Dolls that will talk and go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jenn
And mom and dad can hardly wait
For school to start again

Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel
One in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring
Is the Carol that you sing
Right within your heart

I really can't stayBut baby it's cold outside
I got to go awayBut baby it's cold outside
This evening has beenBeen hoping that you'd drop in
So very niceI'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worryBeautiful, what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floorListen to the fireplace roar
So really, I'd better scurryBeautiful, please don't hurry
But maybe just a half a drink moreI'll put some records on while I pour
The neighbours might thinkBaby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink?No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew howYour eyes are like starlight tonight
To break this spellI'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say, no, no, no sirOh, mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I triedWhat's the sense in hurting my pride?
I really can't stayBut baby, don't hold out
But baby it's cold outside!
[Verse 2: Meghan Trainor & Brett Eldredge]
I simply must goBut baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, no, noAw baby, it's cold outside
Your welcome has beenHow lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warmLook out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspiciousUm gosh, your lips are delicious
And my brother will be there at the doorWaves on a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is viciousOh gosh, your lips are so delicious
But maybe just a cigarette moreOh never such a blizzard before
I've got to get homeBut baby, you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your coatOh up to your knees out there
You've really been grandI thrill when you touch my hand
But you don't see, no, noHow can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrowThink of my life long sorrow
At least there will be plenty impliedIf you cought pneumonia and died
But I really can't stayGet over that whole doubt
But baby it's cold outside!

To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet

I really can't stay (But, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (But, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry (Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)
So, really, I'd better scurry (Beautiful, please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think (Baby, it's bad out there)Say, what's in this drink? (No cab's to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" (Mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)
[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay(Oh, baby, don't hold out)Baby, it's cold outside
[Verse 2: Marilyn Maxwell & Dean Martin]I simply must go (But, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (But, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (Look out the window at the storm)
My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before)
I've gotta get home (But, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (If you got pneumonia and died)
[Chorus: Marilyn Maxwell, Dean Martin & Both]
I really can't stay(Get over that cold out)Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside

Was a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman
Is a fairytale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day
There must have been some magic
In that old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me
Frosty the snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all around the square
Saying catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler stop
Frosty the snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying don't you cry
I'll be back again some day
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at frosty go
Thumpety thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

I thought I'd take a ride
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upsot
A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell;
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! You'll take the lead

You make it feel like Christmas
It barely took a breath to realize
We’re going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
[Pre-Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reactedCan’t believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too
[Chorus: Blake & Gwen]
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
[Verse 2: Blake]Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you baby
'Cause you make it feel like Christmas

I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas

I never thought I’d find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I want to thank you baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oooh, (thank you baby)

I want to thank you baby

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'?
In the lane, snow is glist’nin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland
[Verse 2]
Gone away, is the bluebird
Here to stay, is the new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
[Chorus]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"", We'll say, ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town
[Verse 3]
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Circus Clown
We’ll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kids knock him down
[Verse 4]
When it snows, ain’t it thrillin'
Though your nose, get’s a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
[Outro]
Walkin’ in a winter wonderland
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice as shy
I kept my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
[Verse 2]
""Merry Christmas"", I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
And if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again
[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
[Verse 3]
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
[Verse 4]
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Now, I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again
[Chorus]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

I sat upon your knee
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies
Well I'm all grown up now
And still need help somehow
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream
So here's my lifelong wish
My grown up Christmas list
Not for myself but for a world in need
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
As children we believe
The grandest sight to see
Was something lovely wrapped beneath the tree
But Heaven only knows
That packages and bows
Can never heal a heartached human soul
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
What is this illusion called the innocence of youth
Maybe only in our blind belief can we ever find the truth
No more lives torn apart
That wars would never start
And time would heal all hearts
And everyone would have a friend
And right would always win
And love would never end, no
This is my grown up Christmas list
This is my only lifelong wish
This is my grown up Christmas list

Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones
[Pre-Chorus]
Our love is something priceless
[Chorus]
I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling (No, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you
[Verse 2]
So, Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
Take the day off (Take the day off)
Get a massage (Get a massage)
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey (A little whiskey)
We're getting frisky (Ooh!)And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' (We ain't stressin')
Just caressin' (Mm-hmm)
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' (Nothing's missin')
'Cause you're a blessin' ('Cause you're the blessin')
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for
[Pre-Chorus]

Snow is falling all around us
My baby's coming home for Christmas
I've been up all night inside my bedroom
He said he'll be with me real soon
So I wait
And I wait
But I've had as much as I can take
[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me
Four more days of being lonely
Three more wishes, I can barely breathe
If I can make it to Christmas Eve then it's
One more sleep (one more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)
One more sleep
[Verse 2]
Now I don't think I can remember
A cold and lonelier December
And I find myself singing at the window
Wondering when you're gonna get back home
So I try
And I try
But there is nothing I can do to pass this time
[Chorus]
'Cause I've got five more nights of sleeping on my own
Four more days until you're coming home
Three more dreams of you and mistletoe
Two more reasons why I love you so
I've got five more nights until you're next to me

One more sleep (Can't believe how much I missed us)
One more sleep (One more sleep until it's Christmas)

Until we're rocking around the Christmas tree
Until I got you sitting next to me
We got a lot of catching up to do
I just can't take this missing you

Five more nights on my own
Four more days, hmm
Three more dreams, mistletoe
I can't believe I ever let you go, oh

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
[Chorus]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door
[Hook]
A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow
[Chorus 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
[Hook 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

So it's Christmas once more

He's checking it twice;
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice

He sees you when you're sleeping
And he knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!
You better watch out
You better not cry
You better not pout

Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic
[Verse 1]In my heart is a Christmas tree farmWhere the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coatsAnd the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgivenAnd everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
[Chorus]Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your armsTakes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
[Verse 2]In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your armsTakes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah
[Bridge]And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)

Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep

Then I saw mommy tickle, tickle (tickle, tickle, Santa Claus)
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

He saw mommy kissing (kissing, kissing, Santa Claus)
I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

In the drunk tankAn old man said to me
""Won't see another one""And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'I turned my face away
And dreamed about you
[Verse 2: Shane MacGowan]Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-oneI've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, babyI can see a better time
When all our dreams come true
[Verse 3: Kirsty MacColl]They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the oldWhen you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me
[Verse 4: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan  & Together]You were handsome!You were pretty, Queen of New York City
When the band finished playing
They howled out for moreSinatra was swinging
All the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner
Then danced through the night

And the bells were ringing out
For Christmas day
[Verse 5: Kirsty MacColl & Shane MacGowan]
You're a bum, you're a punkYou're an old slut on junkLying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggotYou cheap, lousy faggotHappy Christmas, your arseI pray God it's our last

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone stray is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say: Are you married?
We'll say: No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland
In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows, ain't it thrilling
Though your nose gets a chilling
We'll frolic and play, the Eskimo way
Just walking, talking
Hand in hand in a crazy winter wonderland

There's a story that I was told
And I wanna tell the world
Before I get too old
And don't remember it
So let's December it
And reassemble it (oh yeah)

Once upon a time in a town like this
A little girl made a great big wish
To fill the world full of happiness
And be on Santa's magic list

At the same time miles away
A little boy made a wish that day
That the world would be okay
And Santa Claus would hear him say:
""I got dreams, and I got love
I got my feet on the ground
And family above
Can you send some happiness
With my best to the rest
Of the people of the East and the West and
Maybe every once in a while you
Give my grandma a reason to smile
'Tis the season of smile
It's cold but we'll be freezing in style
[Pre-Chorus]
Let me meet a girl one day that
Wants to spread some love this way
We can let our souls run free and
She can open some happiness with me""

Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on y'all
It's Christmas time
Shake it up
Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
Come on you all
It's Christmas time

I know you're out there
I hear your reindeer
I see the snow where
Your boots have been
I'm gonna show them
So they will know then
Their love will grow and
They believe again

Shake up the happiness
Wake it up
Wake up the happiness
